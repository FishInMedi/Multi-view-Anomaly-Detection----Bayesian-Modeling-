# Inductive Multi-View Anomaly Detection

Model implementation for IJCAI 2020 paper "Towards a hierachical Bayesian model of multi-view anomaly detection" by Zhen Wang and Chao Lan from University of Wyoming. 

Different from all exsiting multi-view anomaly detection techniques, this work is the first attempt to detect multi-view outliers/anomlies under semi-supervised scenario via a Bayesian model of inductive learning. For details, refer to our paper. 

## Dataset Preparation
Download the below raw datasets, then preprocess them(, mainly feature rescaling) and generate the mutli-view outliers following the strategy mentioned in our paper or related works.
